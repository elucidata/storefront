# Development Notebook

> This document is for me to flesh out my thoughts on current or future features in Storefront. You're welcome to read (and comment) but it may only make to sense me.


## ToDo

- [ ] Add support for renderAnimationFrame onChange batching


## Questions

- Should multiple calls to `Store` (or `Clerk`) merge the definitions? Currently it throws an Error.
